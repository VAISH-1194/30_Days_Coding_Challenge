Question:-
Given the names and grades for each student in a class of  students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

Note: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

Solution:-
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    students = []
    for _ in range(n):
        name = input()
        score = float(input())
        students.append([name, score])
    second_lowest_grade = sorted(set([score for name, score in students]))[1]

    second_lowest_students = [name for name, score in sorted(students) if score == second_lowest_grade]
    for student in sorted(second_lowest_students):
        print(student)
