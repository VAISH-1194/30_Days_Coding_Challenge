Question:-
In this task, we would like for you to appreciate the usefulness of the groupby() function of itertools . To read more about this function, Check this out .

You are given a string . Suppose a character '' occurs consecutively  times in the string. Replace these consecutive occurrences of the character '' with  in the string.

For a better understanding of the problem, check the explanation.

Solution:-
from itertools import groupby

def compress_string(s):
    groups = groupby(s)

    compressed = [(len(list(g)), int(k)) for k, g in groups]

    result = ' '.join(f'({count}, {char})' for count, char in compressed)

    return result

s = input()

result = compress_string(s)
print(result)
