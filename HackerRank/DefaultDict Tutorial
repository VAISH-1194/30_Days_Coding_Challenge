Question:-
The defaultdict tool is a container in the collections class of Python. It's similar to 
the usual dictionary (dict) container, but the only difference is that a defaultdict will have 
a default value if that key has not been set yet. If you didn't use a defaultdict you'd have to 
check to see if that key exists, and if it doesn't, set it to what you want.

Solution:-
from collections import defaultdict

def word_indices(n, m, group_a, group_b):
    positions = defaultdict(list)

    for idx, word in enumerate(group_a, start=1):
        positions[word].append(idx)

    for word in group_b:
        if word in positions:
            print(" ".join(map(str, positions[word])))
        else:
            print("-1")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    group_a = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
    group_b = [input().strip() for _ in range(m)]

    word_indices(n, m, group_a, group_b)
