Question:-
Task

You are given a 2-D array with dimensions X.
Your task is to perform the min function over axis  and then find the max of that.

Solution:-
import numpy as np
n, m = map(int, input().split())

arr = np.array([input().split() for _ in range(n)], dtype=int)

min_result = np.min(arr, axis=1)

max_of_min_result = np.max(min_result)

print(max_of_min_result)
