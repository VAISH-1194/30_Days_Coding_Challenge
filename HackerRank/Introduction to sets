Task

Now, let's use our knowledge of sets and help Mickey.
Ms. Gabriel Williams is a botany professor at District College. One day, 
she asked her student Mickey to compute the average of all the plants with distinct heights in her greenhouse.
Formula used:


Solution:-
def average(array):
    distinct_heights = set(array)
    average_height = sum(distinct_heights) / len(distinct_heights)
    return round(average_height, 3)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = average(arr)
    print(result)
