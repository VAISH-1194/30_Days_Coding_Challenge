Question:-
Let's learn some new Python concepts! You have to generate a list of the first  fibonacci numbers,  being the first number. Then, apply the map function and a lambda expression to cube each fibonacci number and print the list.

Concept

The map() function applies a function to every member of an iterable and returns the result. It takes two parameters: first, the function that is to be applied and secondly, the iterables.
Let's say you are given a list of names, and you have to print a list that contains the length of each name.

>> print (list(map(len, ['Tina', 'Raj', 'Tom'])))  
[4, 3, 3]  
Lambda is a single expression anonymous function often used as an inline function. In simple words, it is a function that has only one line in its body. It proves very handy in functional and GUI programming.

>> sum = lambda a, b, c: a + b + c
>> sum(1, 2, 3)
6

Solution:-
cube = lambda x: x ** 3

def fibonacci(n):
    fib_list = [0, 1]
    while len(fib_list) < n:
        fib_list.append(fib_list[-1] + fib_list[-2])
    return fib_list[:n]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    print(list(map(cube, fibonacci(n))))
