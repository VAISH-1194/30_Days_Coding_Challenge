Question:-
Task

You are given a two lists  and . Your task is to compute their cartesian product X.

Example

A = [1, 2]
B = [3, 4]

AxB = [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)]

Solution:-
from itertools import product

A = list(map(int, input().split()))
B = list(map(int, input().split()))

result = list(product(A, B))

for item in result:
    print(item, end=' ')
