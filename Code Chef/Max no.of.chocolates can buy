Problem:-
Chef has X 5 rupee coins and Y 10 rupee coins. Chef goes to a shop to buy chocolates for Chefina where each chocolate costs 
Z rupees. Find the maximum number of chocolates that Chef can buy for Chefina.

Input format:-
-> The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
-> The first and only line of each test case contains three integers X, 
Y and Z — the number of 5 rupee coins, the number of 10 rupee coins and the cost of each chocolate.

Output format:-
For each test case, output the maximum number of chocolates that Chef can buy for Chefina.

Solution:-

def max_chocolates(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(T):
        X, Y, Z = test_cases[i]
        max_chocolates = (X * 5 + Y * 10) // Z
        results.append(max_chocolates)
    return results


T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    X, Y, Z = map(int, input().split())
    test_cases.append((X, Y, Z))


results = max_chocolates(T, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
