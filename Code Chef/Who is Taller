Input Format
The first line of input will contain an integer 
�
T — the number of test cases. The description of 
�
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers 
�
X and 
�
Y, as described in the problem statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line 
A
A if Alice is taller than Bob, else output 
B
B. The output is case insensitive, i.e, both

            int y = sc.nextInt();

            if (x < y) {
